         <h2> Definition of Cell</h2>
          <p>Cell is the structural and functional unit of life, all living things are made up of one or more cells,<br>
             organism that posses one cell are called unicellular organism, while those with more than one cell are <br>
            grouped under multicellular organism </p>
            <h2>Types of Cell</h2>
            <p1> There are two major types of cell, these are;</p1>
            <ol>
                <li> Plant cell</li>
                <li> Animal cell</li>
